              hundreds of amphibian species and is implicated in global
              amphibian declines. Bd is comprised of several lineages that
              differ in pathogenicity, thus, identifying which Bd strains are
              present in a given amphibian community is essential for
              understanding host-pathogen dynamics. The presence of Bd has been
              confirmed in Central Africa, yet vast expanses of this region
              have not yet been surveyed for Bd prevalence, and the genetic
              diversity of Bd is largely unknown in this part of the world.
              Using retrospective surveys of museum specimens and contemporary
              field surveys, we estimated the prevalence of Bd in Central
              African island and continental amphibian assemblages, and
              genotyped strains of Bd present in each community. Our sampling
              of museum specimens included just a few individuals collected in
              the Gulf of Guinea archipelago prior to 1998, yet one of these
              individuals was Bd-positive indicating that the pathogen has been
              on Bioko Island since 1966. We detected Bd across all subsequent
              sample years in our study and found modest support for a
              relationship between host life history and Bd prevalence, a
              positive relationship between prevalence and host community
              species richness, and no significant relationship between
              elevation and prevalence. The Global Panzootic Lineage (Bd GPL)
              was present in all the island and continental amphibian

  abstract = "With increasing attention being paid to the consequences of
              global biodiversity losses, several recent studies have
              demonstrated that realistic species losses can have larger
              impacts than random species losses on community productivity and
              resilience. However, little is known about the effects of the
              order in which species are lost on biodiversity--disease
              relationships. Using a multiyear nitrogen addition and artificial
              warming experiment in natural assemblages of alpine meadow
              vegetation on the Qinghai-­Tibetan Plateau, we inferred the
              sequence of plant species losses under fertilization/warming.
              Then the sequence of species losses under fertilization/warming
              was used to simulate the species loss orders (both realistic and
              random) in an adjacently novel removal experiment manipulating
              plot-­level plant diversity. We explicitly compared the effect
              sizes of random versus realistic species losses simulated from
              fertilization/warming on plant foliar fungal diseases. We found
              that realistic species losses simulated from fertilization had
              greater effects than random losses on fungal diseases, and that
              species identity drove the diversity--disease relationship.
              Moreover, the plant species most prone to foliar fungal diseases
              were also the least vulnerable to extinction under fertilization,
              demonstrating the importance of protecting low competence species
              (the ability to maintain and transmit fungal infections was low)
              to impede the spread of infectious disease. In contrast, there
              was no difference between random and realistic species loss
              scenarios simulated from experimental warming (or the combination
              of warming and fertilization) on the diversity--disease

              species losses may vary under different drivers.",

  abstract  = "Abstract Community ecology can link habitat to disease via
               interactions among habitat, focal hosts, other hosts, their
               parasites, and predators. However, complicated food web
               interactions (i.e., trophic interactions among predators and
               their impacts on host density and diversity) often obscure the
               important pathways regulating disease. Here, we disentangle
               community drivers in a case study of planktonic disease, using a
               two-step approach. In step one, we tested univariate field
               patterns linking community interactions directly to two disease
               metrics. Density of focal hosts (Daphnia dentifera) was related
               to density but not prevalence of fungal (Metschnikowia
               bicuspidata) infections. Both disease metrics appeared to be
               driven by selective predators that cull infected hosts (fish,
               e.g., Lepomis macrochirus), sloppy predators that spread
               parasites while feeding (midges, Chaoborus punctipennis), and
               spore predators that reduce contact between focal hosts and
               parasites (other zooplankton, especially small-bodied
               Ceriodaphnia sp.). Host diversity also negatively correlated
               with disease, suggesting a dilution effect. However, several of
               these univariate patterns were initially misleading, due to
               confounding ecological links among habitat, predators, host
               density, and host diversity. In step two, path models uncovered
               and explained these misleading patterns, and grounded them in
               habitat structure (refuge size). First, rather than directly
               reducing infection prevalence, fish predation drove disease
               indirectly through changes in density of midges and frequency of
               small spore predators (which became more frequent in lakes with
               small refuges). Second, small spore predators drove the two
               disease metrics through fundamentally different pathways: they
               directly reduced infection prevalence, but indirectly reduced
               density of infected hosts by lowering density of focal hosts
               (likely via competition). Third, the univariate
               diversity?disease pattern (signaling a dilution effect) merely
               reflected the confounding direct effects of these small spore
               predators. Diversity per se had no effect on disease, after
               accounting for the links between small spore predators,
               diversity, and infection prevalence. In turn, these small spore
               predators were regulated by both size-selective fish predation
               and refuge size. Thus, path models not only explain each of
               these surprising results, but also trace their origins back to
               habitat structure.",

  abstract = "In plant pathosystems in which some hosts are transmissive and

              including the susceptibility of both hosts, the sporulation
              potential of transmissive hosts, the mobility of infectious
              propagules, the presence of environmental factors conducive to
              infection, and the variability in distribution of both host
              types. The factors above were studied for the California forest
              disease sudden oak death caused by the pathogen Phytophthora
              ramorum. This pathogen is exotic to California, and while it
              sporulates at signiﬁcant levels on the leaves of California bay
              laurels, four susceptible oak species appear to be non-infectious
              dead-end hosts. Here, we report, for the ﬁrst time, on inoculum
              levels necessary to successfully infect adult oaks and on the
              distribution of such inoculum levels through time and space
              thanks to a seven-year-long monitoring effort across a network of
              128 monitoring points. Through a series of geostatistical and
              statistical analyses, we show that the presence of high inoculum
              loads is positively correlated with close proximity to bay
              laurels, with high rainfall levels, and with warmer temperatures.
              Data are consistent with splash dispersal of the pathogen and
              show that increased presence of tanoak corresponds to a reduced
              presence of bay laurels and to a lower frequency of high inoculum
              events. Removal of bay laurels resulted in a substantial decrease
              of number of events in which spore loads were high enough to
              infect oaks. This effect was signiﬁcant when bays were removed 10
              m around sampling points, thus indicating that removal of bays 10
              m around oaks is a valid approach to reduce infections of oaks.",

  abstract = "Human-altered disturbance regimes and changing climatic
              conditions can reduce seed availability and suitable microsites,
              limiting seedling regeneration in recovering forest systems.
              Thus, resprouting plants, which can persist in situ, are expected
              to expand in dominance in many disturbance-prone forests.
              However, resprouters may also be challenged by changing regimes,
              and the mechanisms determining facultative seedling recruitment
              by resprouting species, which will determine both the future
              spread and current persistence of these populations, are poorly
              understood. In the resprouter-dominated forests of coastal
              California, interactions between wildﬁre and an emerging disease,
              sudden oak death (SOD), alter disturbance severity and tree
              mortality, which may shift forest regeneration trajectories. We
              examine this set of compound disturbances to (1) assess the
              inﬂuence of seed limitation, biotic competition, and abiotic
              conditions on seedling regeneration in resprouting populations;
              (2) investigate whether disease-ﬁre interactions alter postﬁre
              seedling regeneration, which have implications for future disease
              dynamics and shifts in forest composition. Following a wildﬁre
              that impacted a preexisting plot network in SOD-affected forests,
              we monitored seedling abundances and survival over eight years.
              With pre- and postﬁre data, we assessed relationships between
              regeneration dynamics and disturbance severity, biotic, and
              abiotic variables, using Bayesian generalized linear models and
              mixed models. Our results indicate that postﬁre seedling
              regeneration by resprouting species was shaped by contrasting
              mechanisms reﬂecting seed limitation and competitive release.
              Seedling abundances declined with decreasing postﬁre survival of
              mature, conspeciﬁc stems, while belowground survival of
              resprouting genets had no effect. However, where seed sources
              persisted, seedling abundances and survival generally increased
              with the preﬁre severity of disease impacts, suggesting that
              decreased competition with adults may enhance seedling
              recruitment in this resprouter-dominated system. Species'
              regeneration responses varied with their relative susceptibility
              to SOD and suggest compositional shifts, which will determine
              future disease management and forest restoration actions. These
              results additionally highlight that mechanisms related to biotic
              competition, seed limitation, and opportunities for seedling
              recruitment beneath mature canopies may determine possible shifts
              in the occurrence of resprouting traits. This result has broad
              applications to other systems impacted by human-altered regimes

  abstract = "Human-altered ecological disturbances may challenge system
              resilience and disrupt biological legacies maintaining ecosystem
              recovery. Yet, the extent to which novel regimes challenge these
              legacies varies. This may be partially explained by differences
              in the vulnerability of life history strategies to disturbance
              characteristics. In the fire-prone, resprouter-dominated coast
              redwood forests of California, the introduced disease sudden oak
              death (SOD) alters fuel profiles, fire behavior, and aboveground
              tree mortality; however, this system is dominated by resprouting
              trees that are welladapted to aboveground damage, and belowground
              survival of individuals may represent the principal biological
              legacy connecting pre- and post-fire communities. Much of the
              research exploring altered disturbances and forest recovery has
              focused on legacies determined by seed dispersal and aboveground
              survival of adults. In this work, we use pre- and post-fire data
              from a long-term monitoring network to assess the impacts of
              novel disturbance interactions between wildfire and SOD on the
              belowground survival and vegetative reproduction of resprouters.
              We found that increasing accumulation of coarse woody surface
              fuels from SOD-killed hosts decreased the likelihood of
              belowground survival for resprouting tanoak trees, but not for
              redwoods. Tanoaks' belowground survival was negatively related to
              substrate burn severity, which increased with the volume of
              surface fuels from hosts, suggesting heat damage as a possible
              mechanism influencing altered patterns of resprouter mortality.
              These impacts increased with decreasing tree size. By contrast,
              redwood and tanoak trees that survived both disturbances
              resprouted more vigorously, regardless of post-fire infection by
              P. ramorum, and generated similar recruitment at the stand level.
              Our results demonstrate that disease--fire interactions can
              narrow recruitment filters for resprouters, which could impact
              long-term population and demographic structure; yet, compounded
              disturbance may also reduce stand density and disease pressure,
              allowing competitive release of survivors. Resprouters displayed
              vulnerabilities to altered disturbance, but our research suggests
              that legacies maintained by resprouting may be more resilient to
              certain compounded disturbances, compared to seed-obligate
              species, because of high rates of individual survival under
              increasingly severe events. These trends have important
              implications for conservation of declining tree species in
              SOD-impacted forests, as well as predictions of human impacts in
              other disturbance-prone systems where resprouters are present.",

  author   = "Dillon, Whalen W and Meentemeyer, Ross K",
  abstract = "Disease dynamics are governed by variation of individuals,
              species, and environmental conditions across space and time. In
              some cases, an alternate reservoir host amplifies pathogen loads
              and drives disease transmission to less competent hosts in a
              process called pathogen spillover. Spillover is frequently
              associated with multi-host disease systems where a single species
              is more tolerant of infection and more competent in pathogen
              transmission compared to other hosts. Pathogen spillover must be
              driven by biotic factors, including host and community
              characteristics, yet biotic factors interact with the abiotic
              environment (e.g., temperature) to create disease. Despite its
              fundamental role in disease dynamics, the influence of the
              abiotic environment on pathogen spillover has seldom been
              examined. Improving our understanding of disease processes such
              as pathogen spillover hinges on disentangling the effects of
              interrelated biotic and abiotic factors over space and time. We
              applied 10 yr of fine-scale microclimate, disease, and tree
              community data in a path analysis to investigate the relative
              influence of biotic and abiotic factors on pathogen spillover for
              the emerging infectious forest disease sudden oak death (SOD).
              Disease transmission in SOD is primarily driven by the reservoir
              host California bay laurel, which supports high foliar pathogen
              loads that spillover onto neighboring oak trees and create lethal
              canker infections. The foliar pathogen load and susceptibility of
              oaks is expected to be sensitive to forest microclimate
              conditions. We found that biotic factors of pathogen load and
              tree diversity had relatively stronger effects on pathogen
              spillover compared to abiotic microclimate factors, with pathogen
              load increasing oak infection and tree diversity reducing oak
              infection. Abiotic factors still had significant effects, with
              greater heat exposure during summer months reducing pathogen
              loads and optimal pathogen conditions during the wet season
              increasing oak infection. Our results offer clues to possible
              disease dynamics under future climate change where hotter and
              drier or warmer and wetter conditions could have opposing effects
              on pathogen spillover in the SOD system. Disentangling direct and
              indirect effects of biotic and abiotic factors affecting disease
              processes can provide key insights into disease dynamics
              including potential avenues for reducing disease spread and

              explaining this pattern states that, as resource availability
              increases, well-defended, slow-growing species are replaced by
              poorly defended, fast-growing species. A second hypothesis states
              that greater resource availability increases allocation to growth
              at the expense of defense, within species. Regardless of
              mechanism, if exotic species are released from enemies relative
              to natives, shifts in allocation to growth and defense both
              within and among species could differ by geographic provenance.
              To test whether resource availability alters growth or defense,
              within and among species, and whether any such effects differ

              pathogens with free-living stages, such as fungi causing
              catastrophic wildlife declines on a global scale [4], must
              confront lengthy exposure to environmental barriers before

              We present a rule-based model of P. ramorum establishment and
              spread risk in California plant communities. The model, which is
              being used as a management tool to target threatened forests for
              early-detection monitoring and protection, incorporates the
              effects of spatial and temporal variability of multiple variables

              knowledge of host susceptibility, pathogen reproduction, and
              pathogen transmission with particular regard to host species
              distribution and climate suitability. Maps of host species
              distributions and monthly weather conditions were spatially
              analyzed in a GIS and parameterized to encode the magnitude and
              direction of each variable's effect on disease establishment and
              spread. Spread risk predictions were computed for each month of
              the pathogen's general reproductive season and averaged to
              generate a cumulative risk map (Fig. 6a and b). The model
              identiﬁes an alarming number of uninfected forest ecosystems in
              California at considerable risk of infection by Phytophthora
              ramorum. This includes, in particular, a broad band of high risk

              high risk south of central Monterey County south to central San

              currently infested locations than at uninfested locations (P <

              heavily trafﬁcked areas with a history of SOD, and along streams
              known to contain P. ramorum inoculum. Additionally, we tested the
              alternative hypothesis of aerial dispersal, whereby infection in
              the understory would be spatially correlated with overstory
              mortality. Consistent with prior studies into the spatial
              structure of P. ramorum in Oregon, we found no evidence of
              understory infection in close proximity to roads in the absence
              of overstory mortality. Similarly, P. ramorum was only isolated
              from understory vegetation associated with streams when within
              close proximity to overstory sources, and more commonly further
              away from stream edges than within the splash and ﬂood line. Both
              disease patterns are inconsistent with a dominate soil and water
              mediated dispersal mechanism. Rather, we found evidence
              supporting our alternative hypothesis of aerial dispersal whereby
              recovery of P. ramorum in the understory declined with increasing
              distance from the only known overstory source. These results
              support the use of aerial detection in describing the
              distribution of SOD in Oregon, and give further support to
              dispersal of inoculum in blowing fog or rain at scales not yet

  abstract = "The twin concepts of zooprophylaxis and the dilution eﬀect
              originated with vector-borne diseases (malaria), were driven
              forward by studies on Lyme borreliosis and have now developed
              into the mantra ``biodiversity protects against disease''. The
              basic idea is that by diluting the assemblage of
              transmission-competent hosts with non-competent hosts, the
              probability of vectors feeding on transmission-competent hosts is
              reduced and so the abundance of infected vectors is lowered. The
              same principle has recently been applied to other infectious
              disease systems -- tick-borne, insect-borne, indirectly
              transmitted via intermediate hosts, directly transmitted. It is
              claimed that the presence of extra species of various sorts,
              acting through a variety of distinct mechanisms, causes the
              prevalence of infectious agents to decrease. Examination of the
              theoretical and empirical evidence for this hypothesis reveals
              that it applies only in certain circumstances even amongst
              tick-borne diseases, and even less often if considering the
              correct metric -- abundance rather than prevalence of infected
              vectors. Whether dilution or ampliﬁcation occurs depends more on
              speciﬁc community composition than on biodiversity per se. We
              warn against raising a straw man, an untenable argument easily
              dismantled and dismissed. The intrinsic value of protecting

               (finite) saprotrophic spread of the soil-borne fungal plant
               pathogen, Rhizoctonia solani amongst discrete sites of nutrient
               resource. Using simple concepts of percolation theory, we
               predict the critical threshold distance, associated with a
               threshold probability, between donor (colonized) and recipient
               (uncolonized) nutrient sites at which R. solani can spread
               invasively by mycelial growth through a population of nutrient
               sites on a lattice. The critical distance for invasive spread is
               estimated from colonization profiles derived from placement
               experiments that summarize the probability of colonization with
               distance between replicated pairs of colonized and uncolonized
               sites. Colonization profiles were highly nonlinear, decaying
               sigmoidally with distance. Thresholds for invasive spread were
               predicted at inter-site distances of 8.1 mm and 11.8 mm for
               sites of low and high nutrient agar, respectively. In population
               experiments with inter-site distances below the predicted
               thresholds, the spread of the fungus was invasive in all
               replicates. At large distances (>10 mm for low, and >14 mm for
               high nutrient sites) the spread of the fungus was always finite,
               with the proportion of finite replicates decreasing sharply
               close to the percolation threshold. Invasive spread did not
               depend on the furthest extent of growth of the fungus but on
               distances predicted by the percolation thresholds. Invasive
               spread of the fungus is also examined in a more natural and
               variable, nonsterile system involving the growth and
               colonization of a lattice of poppy seeds over sand. The system
               is characterized by a decay in the probability of colonization
               between older poppy seeds, which effectively ?quenches?
               saprotrophic spread. Hence in the population experiments with
               poppy seeds all growth was ultimately finite. The threshold
               distance, corresponding to the critical percolation probability
               for invasive growth changed from 18 mm to 4 mm over 21d leading
               to a switch from invasive to finite growth. We conclude that
               percolation theory can be used to link the growth of individual
               mycelial colonies to the formation of patches that result from
               the colonization of particulate organic matter. The nonlinearity
               of the colonization profiles combined with the presence of a
               percolation threshold means that small changes in the distance

  author   = "Allan, Brian F and Keesing, Felicia and Ostfeld, Richard S",
  abstract = "Abstract: Forest destruction and fragmentation in the United
              States recently have been shown to reduce mammalian species
              diversity and to elevate population densities of white-footed
              mice ( Peromyscus leucopus ). One potential consequence of
              reduced species diversity and high mouse density in small
              fragments is an increase in human exposure to Lyme disease.
              Increased risk of exposure to this disease is expected because of
              the role of the white-footed mouse as the principal natural
              reservoir of the Lyme bacterium, Borrelia burgdorferi.
              Blacklegged ticks ( Ixodes scapularis ) feeding on mice have a
              higher probability of becoming infected with the bacterium than
              do ticks feeding on any other host species. We hypothesized that
              small forest patches ( <2 ha ) have a higher density of infected
              nymphal blacklegged ticks, which is the primary risk factor for
              Lyme disease, than larger patches ( 2--8 ha ). In the summer of
              2000, we sampled tick density and B. burgdorferi infection
              prevalence in 14 maple-dominated forest patches, ranging in size
              from 0.7 to 7.6 ha, in Dutchess County of southeastern New York
              state. We found a significant linear decline in nymphal infection
              prevalence with increasing patch area and a significant
              exponential decline in nymphal density with increasing patch
              area. The consequence was a dramatic increase in the density of
              infected nymphs, and therefore in Lyme disease risk, with
              decreasing forest patch size. We did not observe a similar
              relationship between the density of larval ticks and patch size.
              These results suggest that by influencing the community
              composition of vertebrate hosts for disease-bearing vectors,
              habitat fragmentation can influence human health.",

               even after jointly considering the effect of potential biotic
               and abiotic correlates. Lower host-species richness and
               suboptimal microclimates for Bd in disturbed habitats are
               potential mechanisms underlying this pattern. Furthermore, we
               found that anthropogenic deforestation practices biased to
               lowlands and natural vegetation remaining in inaccessible
               highlands explain increased Bd occurrence at higher elevations.
               At a smaller spatial scale, holding constant elevation,

              nature conservation programs, and has been a source of much
              recent scientific debate. In the case of rodent-borne zoonoses,
              there is strong conceptual support, but limited empirical
              evidence, for the hypothesis that defaunation, the loss of large
              wildlife, increases zoonotic disease risk by directly or
              indirectly releasing controls on rodent density. We tested this
              hypothesis by experimentally excluding large wildlife from a
              savanna ecosystem in East Africa, and examining changes in
              prevalence and abundance of Bartonella spp. infection in rodents
              and their flea vectors. We found no effect of wildlife removal on
              per capita prevalence of Bartonella infection in either rodents

              abundance doubled following experimental defaunation, the density

              regulation pathways and host/vector density responses in

              are drastically reducing biodiversity. These concurrent patterns
              have prompted repeated suggestions that biodiversity and disease
              are linked. For example, the dilution effect hypothesis posits
              that these patterns are causally related; diverse host
              communities inhibit the spread of parasites via several
              mechanisms, such as by regulating populations of susceptible
              hosts or interfering with parasite transmission. However, the
              generality of the dilution effect hypothesis remains
              controversial, especially for zoonotic diseases of humans. Here
              we provide broad evidence that host diversity inhibits parasite
              abundance using a meta-analysis of 202 effect sizes on 61
              parasite species. The magnitude of these effects was independent
              of host density, study design, and type and specialization of
              parasites, indicating that dilution was robust across all
              ecological contexts examined. However, the magnitude of dilution
              was more closely related to the frequency, rather than density,
              of focal host species. Importantly, observational studies
              overwhelmingly documented dilution effects, and there was also
              significant evidence for dilution effects of zoonotic parasites
              of humans. Thus, dilution effects occur commonly in nature, and
              they may modulate human disease risk. A second analysis
              identified similar effects of diversity in plant--herbivore
              systems. Thus, although there can be exceptions, our results
              indicate that biodiversity generally decreases parasitism and
              herbivory. Consequently, anthropogenic declines in biodiversity

              there has been no large-scale attempt to slow the spread of the
              pathogen in California. Here we use a stochastic spatially
              explicit model parameterized using data on the spread of P.
              ramorum to investigate whether and how the epidemic can be
              controlled. We find that slowing the spread of P. ramorum is now
              not possible, and has been impossible for a number of years.
              However, despite extensive cryptic (i.e., presymptomatic)
              infection and frequent long-range transmission, effective
              exclusion of the pathogen from large parts of the state could, in

              decrease or increase in infection prevalence, termed the dilution
              and amplification effects, respectively, has been hotly debated
              in disease ecology. Sin Nombre hantavirus, which has an ∼35\%
              mortality rate when it spills over into humans, occurs at a lower
              prevalence in the reservoir host, the North American deermouse,
              in areas with higher small mammal diversity---a dilution effect.
              However, the mechanism driving this relationship is not
              understood. Using a mechanistic mathematical model of infection
              dynamics and a unique long-term, high-resolution, multisite
              dataset, it appears that the observed dilution effect is a result
              of increasing small-mammal diversity leading to decreased
              deermouse population density and, subsequently, prevalence (a
              result of density-dependent transmission). However, once density

              rate at sites with higher diversity---a component amplification
              effect. Therefore, dilution and amplification are occurring at
              the same time in the same host--pathogen system; there is a
              component amplification effect (increase in transmission rate),
              but overall a net dilution because the effect of diversity on
              reservoir host population density is stronger. These results

  abstract = "Pathogens that infect multiple hosts are commonly transmitted by
              vectors, and their transmission rate is often thought to depend
              on the proportion of hosts or vectors infected (i.e., frequency
              dependence). A model of a two-host, one-pathogen system with
              frequency-dependent transmission is used to investigate how
              sharing a pathogen with an alternative host inﬂuences
              pathogen-mediated extinction. The results show that if there is
              frequency-dependent transmission, a host can be rescued from
              pathogen-mediated extinction by the presence of a second host
              with which it shares a pathogen. The study provides an important
              conceptual counterexample to the idea that shared pathogens
              necessarily result in apparent competition by showing that shared
              pathogens can mediate apparent mutualism. We distinguish two
              types of dilution effect (pathogen reduction with increasing host
              diversity), each resulting from different underlying pathogen
              transmission processes and host density effects. These results

              Andes virus (ANDV) host (Oligoryzomys longicaudatus), ANDV
              prevalence, and temporal variability associated with rural

              in peridomestic settings and nearby sylvan areas for 2 years. The
              numerically dominant species differed between peridomestic and
              sylvan settings. O. longicaudatus was the most abundant species

              inferences tied to assemblage structure. Two contrasting outcomes
              of this relationship have been proposed: the ``dilution effect''
              and the ``amplification effect.'' Small mammal assemblage
              structure in disturbed habitats often differs from assemblages in
              sylvan environments, and hantavirus prevalence is often
              negatively correlated with habitats containing high species
              diversity via dilution effect dynamics. As species richness
              increases, prevalence of infection often is decreased. However,
              anthropogenic changes to sylvan landscapes have been shown to
              decrease species richness and/or increase phylogenetic
              similarities within assemblages. Between January 2011 and January
              2016, we captured and tested 2406 individual small mammals for
              hantavirus antibodies at 20 sites across Texas and M{\'e}xico and
              compared differences in hantavirus seroprevalence, species
              composition, and assemblage structure between sylvan and
              disturbed habitats. We found 313 small mammals positive for
              antibodies against hantaviruses, evincing an overall prevalence
              of 9.7\% across all sites. In total, 40 species of small mammals
              were identified comprising 2 taxonomic orders (Rodentia and
              Eulipotyphla). By sampling both habitat types concurrently, we

              dilution effect theory in terms of hantavirus ecology. Our
              hypothesis predicting greater species richness higher in sylvan
              habitats compared to disturbed areas was not supported,
              suggesting the characteristics of assemblage structure do not

              species abundance and prevalence of four generalist
              aphid-vectored pathogens (barley and cereal yellow dwarf viruses)
              in a ubiquitous annual grass host at 10 sites spanning 2000 km

               predict, especially when parasites interact with multiple
               species. Traits of focal hosts like susceptibility could
               directly predict epidemic size, while other traits including
               competitive ability might shape it indirectly in communities
               with a ?dilution effect.? In a dilution effect, diluter taxa can
               reduce disease by regulating (lowering) the density of focal
               hosts (i.e. through competition) or by reducing encounters
               between focal hosts and parasites. However, these dilution
               mechanisms are rarely grounded in focal host traits, and the
               relative importance of host regulation vs. encounter reduction
               remains understudied. Here, we map focal host traits to
               disease?via these dilution mechanisms?in communities with
               diluters. We measured two traits (competitive ability and
               susceptibility) for eight genotypes of a focal host (Daphnia),
               tracked the densities of each genotype in experimental mesocosms
               (+/? Ceriodaphnia competitor/diluters) and monitored their
               infections with a virulent fungal parasite (Metschnikowia) over
               6?8 host generations. We disentangled the impacts of both traits
               on the density of infected hosts and partitioned dilution
               mechanisms using path models. Higher susceptibility directly
               fuelled larger epidemics. Simultaneously, weaker competitive
               ability indirectly suppressed epidemics by enabling higher
               densities of diluters. These higher densities of diluters
               reduced the density of infected hosts indirectly via host
               regulation. In contrast, encounter reduction was much weaker.
               Our experiment strengthens the dilution effect paradigm with a

               traits?susceptibility, competitive ability and their

  abstract  = "Abstract Anthropogenic activities have altered historical
               disturbance regimes, and understanding the mechanisms by which
               these shifting perturbations interact is essential to predicting
               where they may erode ecosystem resilience. Emerging infectious
               plant diseases, caused by human translocation of nonnative
               pathogens, can generate ecologically damaging forms of novel
               biotic disturbance. Further, abiotic disturbances, such as
               wildfire, may influence the severity and extent of
               disease-related perturbations via their effects on the
               occurrence of hosts, pathogens and microclimates; however, these
               interactions have rarely been examined. The disease ?sudden oak
               death? (SOD), associated with the introduced pathogen
               Phytophthora ramorum, causes acute, landscape-scale tree
               mortality in California's fire-prone coastal forests. Here, we
               examined interactions between wildfire and the biotic
               disturbance impacts of this emerging infectious disease.
               Leveraging long-term datasets that describe wildfire occurrence
               and P. ramorum dynamics across the Big Sur region, we modelled
               the influence of recent and historical fires on epidemiological
               parameters, including pathogen presence, infestation intensity,
               reinvasion, and host mortality. Past wildfire altered disease
               dynamics and reduced SOD-related mortality, indicating a
               negative interaction between these abiotic and biotic
               disturbances. Frequently burned forests were less likely to be
               invaded by P. ramorum, had lower incidence of host infection,
               and exhibited decreased disease-related biotic disturbance,
               which was associated with reduced occurrence and density of
               epidemiologically significant hosts. Following a recent
               wildfire, survival of mature bay laurel, a key sporulating host,
               was the primary driver of P. ramorum infestation and reinvasion,
               but younger, rapidly regenerating host vegetation capable of
               sporulation did not measurably influence disease dynamics.
               Notably, the effect of P. ramorum infection on host mortality
               was reduced in recently burned areas, indicating that the loss
               of tall, mature host canopies may temporarily dampen pathogen
               transmission and ?release? susceptible species from significant
               inoculum pressure. Synthesis. Cumulatively, our findings
               indicate that fire history has contributed to heterogeneous
               patterns of biotic disturbance and disease-related decline

  author   = "Keesing, F and Holt, R D and Ostfeld, R S",
  abstract = "The transmission of infectious diseases is an inherently
              ecological process involving interactions among at least two, and
              often many, species. Not surprisingly, then, the species
              diversity of ecological communities can potentially affect the
              prevalence of infectious diseases. Although a number of studies
              have now identiﬁed effects of diversity on disease prevalence,
              the mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear in many
              cases. Starting with simple epidemiological models, we describe a
              suite of mechanisms through which diversity could increase or
              decrease disease risk, and illustrate the potential applicability
              of these mechanisms for both vector-borne and non-vector-borne
              diseases, and for both specialist and generalist pathogens. We
              review examples of how these mechanisms may operate in speciﬁc
              disease systems. Because the effects of diversity on multi-host
              disease systems have been the subject of much recent research and
              controversy, we describe several recent efforts to delineate
              under what general conditions host diversity should increase or
              decrease disease prevalence, and illustrate these with examples.
              Both models and literature reviews suggest that high host
              diversity is more likely to decrease than increase disease risk.
              Reduced disease risk with increasing host diversity is especially
              likely when pathogen transmission is frequency-dependent, and
              when pathogen transmission is greater within species than between
              species, particularly when the most competent hosts are also
              relatively abundant and widespread. We conclude by identifying
              focal areas for future research, including (1) describing
              patterns of change in disease risk with changing diversity; (2)
              identifying the mechanisms responsible for observed changes in
              risk; (3) clarifying additional mechanisms in a wider range of
              epidemiological models; and (4) experimentally manipulating
              disease systems to assess the impact of proposed mechanisms.",

              diversity within host populations, species diversity within host
              communities, and diversity among communities. In principle,
              diversity can either increase or decrease pathogen transmission
              and disease risk. Theoretical models and laboratory experiments
              have demonstrated that a dilution effect (decreased disease risk
              with increasing diversity) can occur under a wide range of
              conditions. Field studies of plants, aquatic invertebrates,
              amphibians, birds, and mammals demonstrate that the phenomenon
              indeed does occur in many natural systems. A dilution effect is
              expected when (a) hosts differ in quality for pathogens or
              vectors; (b) higher quality hosts tend to occur in species-poor
              communities, whereas lower quality hosts tend to occur in more
              diverse communities; and (c) lower quality hosts regulate
              abundance of high-quality hosts or of vectors, or reduce
              encounter rates between these hosts and pathogens or vectors.
              Although these conditions characterize many disease systems, our
              ability to predict when and where the dilution effect occurs
              remains poor. The life-history traits that cause some hosts to be
              widespread and resilient might be correlated with those that
              promote infection and transmission by some pathogens, supporting
              the notion that the dilution effect might be widespread among
              disease systems. Criticisms of the dilution effect have focused
              on whether species richness or species composition (both being
              metrics of biodiversity) drives disease risk. It is well
              established, however, that changes in species composition
              correlate with changes in species richness, and this correlation
              could explain why the dilution effect appears to be a general
              phenomenon.",

              within a community of hosts), and not simply host diversity or

              decreases disease has not considered the relationships between
              host richness and abundance that may exist in natural systems.
              Here we use a multi-species model to study how the scaling of
              total host community abundance with species richness mediates
              diversity-disease relationships. For pathogens with
              density-dependent transmission, non-monotonic trends emerge
              between pathogen transmission and host richness when host
              community abundance saturates with richness. Further, host
              species identity drives high variability in pathogen transmission
              in depauperate communities, but this effect diminishes as host
              richness accumulates. Using simulation we show that high
              variability in low richness communities and the non-monotonic

              application for nestedness analysis that can be used online or
              locally under diﬀerent operating systems. NeD is able to
              automatically handle diﬀerent matrix formats, has batch
              functionalities and produces an output that can be easily copied
              and pasted to a spreadsheet. In addition to numerical results,
              NeD provides a graphic representation of the matrix under

              allows users to select among the most used nestedness metrics,

              models to predict future infections and to guide early-detection
              sampling. Overall, 78 new infections were observed up to 33.5 km
              from the nearest known site of infection, with slightly
              increasing rates of prevalence across time windows (2003, 6.5\%;
              2003--2004, 7.1\%; 2003--2005, 9.6\%). The pathogen was not

              vegetation. The generalized linear modeling indicated that the
              probability of invasion is limited by both dispersal and niche
              constraints. Probability of invasion was positively related to
              precipitation and temperature in the wet season and the presence
              of the inoculum-producing foliar host Umbellularia californica

              Models that incorporated niche and dispersal parameters best

              P. ramorum ranges in its ability to infect, sporulate on, and

              are mediated by landscape characteristics and regional-scale

              the dynamics of barley and cereal yellow dwarf viruses (B/CYDV)
              in the open meadows of the Cascade Mountains of Oregon. B/CYDV is
              an aphid-transmitted, generalist pathogen of over 100 wild and
              cultivated grass species. We used variance components analysis
              and model selection techniques to partition the sources of
              variation in B/ CYDV prevalence and to determine which abiotic

              there is a critical need for studies that empirically identify
              the mechanisms underlying the diversity--disease relationship.
              Here, we combined wetland surveys of host community structure
              with mechanistic experiments involving a multi-host parasite to
              evaluate competing explanations for the dilution effect. Sampling
              of 320 wetlands in California indicated that snail host
              communities were strongly nested, with competent hosts for the
              trematode Ribeiroia ondatrae predominating in low-richness
              assemblages and unsuitable hosts increasingly present in more
              diverse communities. Moreover, competent host density was
              negatively associated with increases in snail species richness.
              These patterns in host community assembly support a key
              prerequisite underlying the dilution effect. Results of
              multigenerational mesocosm experiments designed to mimic
              field-observed community assemblages allowed us to evaluate the
              relative importance of host density and diversity in influencing
              parasite infection success. Increases in snail species richness
              (from one to four species) had sharply negative effects on the
              density of infected hosts (∼90\% reduction). However, this effect
              was indirect; competition associated with non-host species led to
              a 95\% reduction in host density (susceptible host regulation),
              owing primarily to a reduction in host reproduction. Among
              susceptible hosts, there were no differences in infection
              prevalence as a function of community structure, indicating a
              lack of support for a direct effect of diversity on infection
              (encounter reduction). In monospecific conditions, higher initial
              host densities increased infection among adult hosts; however,
              compensatory reproduction in the low-density treatments equalized
              the final number of infected hosts by the next generation,
              underscoring the relevance of multigenerational studies in
              understanding the dilution effect. These findings highlight the
              role of interspecific competition in mediating the relationship
              between species richness and parasite infection and emphasize the

  abstract = "Control of human infectious disease has been promoted as a
              valuable ecosystem service arising from the conservation of
              biodiversity. There are two commonly discussed mechanisms by
              which biodiversity loss could increase rates of infectious
              disease in a landscape. First, loss of competitors or predators
              could facilitate an increase in the abundance of competent
              reservoir hosts. Second, biodiversity loss could
              disproportionately affect noncompetent, or less competent
              reservoir hosts, which would otherwise interfere with pathogen
              transmission to human populations by, for example, wasting the
              bites of infected vectors. A negative association between
              biodiversity and disease risk, sometimes called the ``dilution
              effect hypothesis,'' has been supported for a few disease agents,
              suggests an exciting win--win outcome for the environment and
              society, and has become a pervasive topic in the disease ecology
              literature. Case studies have been assembled to argue that the
              dilution effect is general across disease agents. Less touted are
              examples in which elevated biodiversity does not affect or
              increases infectious disease risk for pathogens of public health
              concern. In order to assess the likely generality of the dilution
              effect, we review the association between biodiversity and public
              health across a broad variety of human disease agents. Overall,
              we hypothesize that conditions for the dilution effect are
              unlikely to be met for most important diseases of humans.
              Biodiversity probably has little net effect on most human
              infectious diseases but, when it does have an effect, observation
              and basic logic suggest that biodiversity will be more likely to

              interactions across large geographic extents and over meaningful
              time scales limit our ability to understand and manage wildland
              epidemics. We conducted a landscape-s­cale, longitudinal study
              designed to analyze the dynamics of sudden oak death (an emerging
              forest disease caused by Phytophthora ramorum) across
              hierarchical levels of ecological interactions, from individual
              hosts up to the community and across the broader landscape. From
              2004 to 2011, we annually assessed disease status of 732 coast
              live oak, 271 black oak, and 122 canyon live oak trees in 202
              plots across a 275-­km2 landscape in central California. The
              number of infected oak stems steadily increased during the
              eight-y­ear study period. A ­survival analysis modeling framework
              was used to examine which level of ecological heterogeneity best
              predicted infection risk of susceptible oak species, considering
              variability at the level of individuals (species identity, stem
              size), the community (host density, inoculum load, and species
              richness), and the landscape (seasonal climate variability,
              habitat connectivity, and topographic gradients). After
              accounting for unobserved risk shared among oaks in the same
              plot, survival models incorporating heterogeneity across all
              three levels better predicted oak infection than did models
              focusing on only one level. We show that larger oak trees
              (especially coast live oak) were more susceptible, and that
              interannual variability in inoculum production by the highly
              infectious reservoir host, California bay laurel, more strongly
              influenced disease risk than simply the density of this important
              host. Concurrently, warmer and wetter rainy-s­eason conditions in
              consecutive years intensified infection risk, presumably by
              creating a longer period of inoculum build-u­ p and increased
              probability of pathogen spillover from bay laurel to oaks.
              Despite the presence of many alternate host species, we found
              evidence of pathogen dilution, where less competent hosts in
              species-­rich communities reduce pathogen transmission and
              overall risk of oak infection. These results identify key

              changes to the composition of forests, and these changes may have

              emergent forest disease sudden oak death (SOD), has a wide host
              range, but mortality is concentrated in a few dominant tree

              interactions between P. ramorum and its hosts in redwood and
              mixed evergreen forest types over an 80,000 ha area in the Big
              Sur ecoregion of central California, an area that constitutes the
              southernmost range of the pathogen and includes forest stands on
              the advancing front of pathogen invasion. We established a
              network of 280 long-term forest monitoring plots to understand
              how host composition and forest structure facilitated pathogen
              invasion, and whether selective mortality from SOD has led to
              shifts in community composition. Infested and uninfested sites
              differed significantly in host composition due to both historical
              trends and disease impacts. A reconstruction of pre-disease
              forest composition showed that stands that eventually became
              infested with the pathogen tended to be more mature with larger
              stems than stands that remained pathogen-free, supporting the
              hypothesis of aerial dispersal by the pathogen across the
              landscape followed by local understory spread. The change in
              species composition in uninfested areas was minimal over the

              composition, correlated with the loss of tanoak (Notholithocarpus
              densiflorus), signaling the potential for SOD to dramatically
              change coastal forests through selective removal of a dominant
              host. Forest diversity plays an important role in pathogen
              establishment and spread, and is in turn changed by pathogen
              impacts. Asymmetric competency among host species means that
              impacts of P. ramorum on forest diversity are shaped by the
              combination and dominance of hosts present in a stand.",

               needed for quantitative prediction of epidemic outcomes and

               spatio-temporal, stochastic epidemiological modeling in

               through heterogeneous host populations in wildland forests,
               subject to fluctuating weather conditions. The model considers
               three stochastic processes: (1) the production of inoculum at a
               given site; (2) the chance that inoculum is dispersed within and
               among sites; and (3) the probability of infection following
               transmission to susceptible host vegetation. We parameterized
               the model using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimation from
               snapshots of local- and regional-scale data on disease spread,
               taking account of landscape heterogeneity and the principal
               scales of spread. Our application of the model to Californian
               landscapes over a 40-year period (1990?2030), since the
               approximate time of pathogen introduction, revealed key
               parameters driving the spatial spread of disease and the
               magnitude of stochastic variability in epidemic outcomes.
               Results show that most disease spread occurs via local dispersal
               (<250 m) but infrequent long-distance dispersal events can
               substantially accelerate epidemic spread in regions with high
               host availability and suitable weather conditions. In the
               absence of extensive control, we predict a ten-fold increase in
               disease spread between 2010 and 2030 with most infection
               concentrated along the north coast between San Francisco and
               Oregon. Long-range dispersal of inoculum to susceptible host
               communities in the Sierra Nevada foothills and coastal southern
               California leads to little secondary infection due to lower host
               availability and less suitable weather conditions. However, a
               shift to wetter and milder conditions in future years would
               double the amount of disease spread in California through 2030.
               This research illustrates how stochastic epidemiological models
               can be applied to realistic geographies and used to increase

              North American forest biodiversity, structure, and ecosystem
              function over the last 150 years. Since the mid-1990s, coastal
              California forests have suffered extensive decline of the endemic
              overstory tree tanoak, Notholithocarpus densiflorus (Hook. \&
              Arn.) Manos, Cannon \& S. H. Oh (Fagaceae), following the
              emergence of the exotic pathogen Phythophthora ramorum and the
              resulting disease sudden oak death. There are two central
              challenges to protecting tanoak: 1) the pathogen P. ramorum has
              multiple pathways of spread and is thus very difficult to
              eradicate, and 2) the low economic valuation of tanoak obscures
              the cultural and ecological importance of this species. However,
              both modeling and field studies have shown that pathogen-centric
              management and host-centric preventative treatments are effective
              methods to reduce rates of spread, local pathogen prevalence, and
              to increase protection of individual trees. These management
              strategies are not mutually exclusive, but we lack precise
              understanding of the timing and extent to apply each strategy in
              order to minimize disease and the subsequent accumulation of
              fuels, loss of obligate flora and fauna, or destruction of
              culturally important stands. Recent work identifying heritable
              disease resistance traits, ameliorative treatments that reduce
              pathogen populations, and silvicultural treatments that shift
              stand composition hold promise for increasing the resiliency of
              tanoak populations. We suggest distinct strategies for pathogen
              invaded and uninvaded areas, place these in the context of local
              management goals, and suggest a management strategy and
              associated research priorities to retain the biodiversity and
              cultural values associated with tanoak.",

  abstract = "Forests at risk to diseases caused by invasive Phytophthora
              pathogens can be grouped into two broad classes: those already
              invaded by the focal pathogen where disease has emerged or those
              at significant risk of invasion and subsequent emergence of
              disease. This dichotomy represents distinct management scenarios
              -- treating after or before disease emerges -- with a set of
              epidemiological, ecological, and practical management
              characteristics that determine optimal actions and associated
              costs. Here we present the initial outcomes from two management
              experiments aimed at restoring forest structure or protecting
              against changes to forest structure following invasion of
              Phytophthora ramorum, the cause of sudden oak death (SOD). We
              conducted a stand-level restoration experiment on Mount Tamalpais
              (Marin County, CA) at three sites where the disease has killed
              most overstory tanoak and dramatically increased understory
              vegetation density and fuels. A separate experiment in an
              uninvaded, at risk forest was conducted near Lacks Creek, in
              Humboldt County. This treatment is an attempt to increase forest
              resiliency to catastrophic loss of tanoak, increased fuels
              associated with tree mortality, and densification of the
              understory that are expected to accompany disease in these stands
              within the coming decade. Restoration experiments employed two
              types of mastication of understory vegetation and hand-crew
              thinning with pile burning; resiliency experiments employed hand
              crews. Treatments were compared to a set of reference conditions
              representing overly dense stands where intervention is needed and
              extensively managed stands that serve as management targets. Both
              restoration and resiliency treatments greatly reduced density of
              key sporulation supporting hosts with modest-to-minimal effects
              on stand basal area. Prior land use, especially past harvesting,
              was a primary factor determining treatment costs and potential
              disease impacts in treated vs untreated stands. Although both
              restoration and resiliency management strategies are likely to
              reduce disease impacts, treatment costs vary substantially and
              will greatly influence when and where each approach is optimal.",

  author   = "Mitchell, Charles E and Tilman, David and Groth, James V",
  abstract = "In an experiment that directly manipulated grassland plant
              species richness and composition, decreased plant species
              richness (``diversity'') increased pathogen load (the percentage
              of leaf area infected by species-speciﬁc foliar pathogens across
              the plant community) in 1998. Pathogen load was almost three
              times greater in the average monoculture than in the average plot
              planted with 24 grassland plant species, an approximately natural
              diversity. Eleven individual diseases increased in severity
              (percentage of leaf area infected by a single disease) at lower
              plant species richness, and severity of only one disease was
              positively correlated with diversity. For 10 of the 11 diseases
              whose severity was negatively related to diversity, disease
              severity was positively correlated with host abundance, and in
              six of these cases, species diversity had no effect on disease
              severity after controlling for the effects of host abundance.
              These results suggest that increased abundances of individual
              host species at lower species diversity increased disease
              transmission and severity. In 1996 and 1997, similar results for
              a smaller number of diseases sampled were found in this
              experiment and another similar one. Although the effect of
              diversity on disease was highly signiﬁcant, considerable variance
              in pathogen load remained among plots of a given diversity level.
              Much of this residual variance was explained by community
              characteristics that were a function of the species composition
              of the communities (the identity of species present vs. those
              lost). Speciﬁcally, communities that lost less diseaseprone
              species had higher pathogen loads; this effect explained more
              variance in pathogen load than did diversity. Also, communities
              that lost the species dominant at high diversity had higher
              pathogen loads, presumably because relaxed competition allowed
              greater increases in host abundances, but this effect was weak.
              Among plant species, disease proneness appeared to be determined
              more by regional than local processes, because it was better
              correlated with frequency of the plant species' populations
              across the region than with local abundance or frequency across
              the state. In total, our results support the hypothesis that
              decreased species diversity will increase foliar pathogen load if
              this increases host abundance and, therefore, disease
              transmission. Additionally, changes in community characteristics
              determined by species composition will strongly inﬂuence pathogen
              load.",

              hosts and/or decoys (i.e. non-competent hosts) for two trematode
              parasite species, Echinostoma trivolvis and Ribeiroia ondatrae,
              which commonly infect wildlife across North America. We
              manipulated the density of a focal host (green frog tadpoles,
              Rana clamitans), in concert with manipulating the diversity of
              alternative species, to simulate communities where alternative
              species either (1) replace the focal host species so that the
              total number of individuals remains constant (substitution) or
              (2) add to total host density (addition). For E. trivolvis, we
              found that total parasite transmission remained roughly equal (or
              perhaps decreased slightly) when alternative species replaced
              focal host individuals, but parasite transmission was higher when
              alternative species were added to a community without replacing
              focal host individuals. Given the alternative species were
              roughly equal in competency, these results are consistent with
              current theory. Remarkably, both total tadpole and per-capita
              tadpole infection intensity by E. trivolvis increased with
              increasing intraspecific host density. For R. ondatrae,
              alternative species did not function as effective decoys or hosts
              for parasite infective stages, and the diversity and density
              treatments did not produce clear changes in parasite
              transmission, although high tank to tank variation in R. ondatrae
