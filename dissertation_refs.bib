  abstract  = "Abstract The size of disease epidemics remains difficult to
               predict, especially when parasites interact with multiple
               species. Traits of focal hosts like susceptibility could
               directly predict epidemic size, while other traits including
               competitive ability might shape it indirectly in communities
               with a ?dilution effect.? In a dilution effect, diluter taxa can
               reduce disease by regulating (lowering) the density of focal
               hosts (i.e. through competition) or by reducing encounters
               between focal hosts and parasites. However, these dilution
               mechanisms are rarely grounded in focal host traits, and the
               relative importance of host regulation vs. encounter reduction
               remains understudied. Here, we map focal host traits to
               disease?via these dilution mechanisms?in communities with
               diluters. We measured two traits (competitive ability and
               susceptibility) for eight genotypes of a focal host (Daphnia),
               tracked the densities of each genotype in experimental mesocosms
               (+/? Ceriodaphnia competitor/diluters) and monitored their
               infections with a virulent fungal parasite (Metschnikowia) over
               6?8 host generations. We disentangled the impacts of both traits
               on the density of infected hosts and partitioned dilution
               mechanisms using path models. Higher susceptibility directly
               fuelled larger epidemics. Simultaneously, weaker competitive
               ability indirectly suppressed epidemics by enabling higher
               densities of diluters. These higher densities of diluters
               reduced the density of infected hosts indirectly via host
               regulation. In contrast, encounter reduction was much weaker.
               Our experiment strengthens the dilution effect paradigm with a
               predictable, traits-oriented framework. Similar
               traits?susceptibility, competitive ability and their
               covariance?could help predict epidemic severity in a variety of
               other systems. Partitioning the direct and indirect effects of
               diluters could also delineate how they impact disease. Such
               trait-based insights could help broadly predict the size of
               epidemics in diverse communities. A plain language summary is

  abstract  = "Abstract Community ecology can link habitat to disease via
               interactions among habitat, focal hosts, other hosts, their
               parasites, and predators. However, complicated food web
               interactions (i.e., trophic interactions among predators and
               their impacts on host density and diversity) often obscure the
               important pathways regulating disease. Here, we disentangle
               community drivers in a case study of planktonic disease, using a
               two-step approach. In step one, we tested univariate field
               patterns linking community interactions directly to two disease
               metrics. Density of focal hosts (Daphnia dentifera) was related
               to density but not prevalence of fungal (Metschnikowia
               bicuspidata) infections. Both disease metrics appeared to be
               driven by selective predators that cull infected hosts (fish,
               e.g., Lepomis macrochirus), sloppy predators that spread
               parasites while feeding (midges, Chaoborus punctipennis), and
               spore predators that reduce contact between focal hosts and
               parasites (other zooplankton, especially small-bodied
               Ceriodaphnia sp.). Host diversity also negatively correlated
               with disease, suggesting a dilution effect. However, several of
               these univariate patterns were initially misleading, due to
               confounding ecological links among habitat, predators, host
               density, and host diversity. In step two, path models uncovered
               and explained these misleading patterns, and grounded them in
               habitat structure (refuge size). First, rather than directly
               reducing infection prevalence, fish predation drove disease
               indirectly through changes in density of midges and frequency of
               small spore predators (which became more frequent in lakes with
               small refuges). Second, small spore predators drove the two
               disease metrics through fundamentally different pathways: they
               directly reduced infection prevalence, but indirectly reduced
               density of infected hosts by lowering density of focal hosts
               (likely via competition). Third, the univariate
               diversity?disease pattern (signaling a dilution effect) merely
               reflected the confounding direct effects of these small spore
               predators. Diversity per se had no effect on disease, after
               accounting for the links between small spore predators,
               diversity, and infection prevalence. In turn, these small spore
               predators were regulated by both size-selective fish predation
               and refuge size. Thus, path models not only explain each of
               these surprising results, but also trace their origins back to
               habitat structure.",

              in a population that are infected by a pathogen, with most
              inferences tied to assemblage structure. Two contrasting outcomes
              of this relationship have been proposed: the ``dilution effect''
              and the ``amplification effect.'' Small mammal assemblage
              structure in disturbed habitats often differs from assemblages in
              sylvan environments, and hantavirus prevalence is often
              negatively correlated with habitats containing high species
              diversity via dilution effect dynamics. As species richness
              increases, prevalence of infection often is decreased. However,
              anthropogenic changes to sylvan landscapes have been shown to
              decrease species richness and/or increase phylogenetic
              similarities within assemblages. Between January 2011 and January

              hantavirus antibodies at 20 sites across Texas and M{\'e}xico and

              dilution effect theory in terms of hantavirus ecology. Our
              hypothesis predicting greater species richness higher in sylvan
              habitats compared to disturbed areas was not supported,
              suggesting the characteristics of assemblage structure do not

               composition, contribute to pathogen spread for many

               pathogens and hosts may clarify whether particular host or
               pathogen traits consistently drive links between community
               factors and pathogen prevalence. Pollinators are a good system
               to test how community composition influences pathogen spread
               because pollinator communities are extremely variable and
               contain several multi-host pathogens transmitted on shared
               floral resources. We conducted a field survey of four pollinator
               species to test the prevalence of three RNA viruses (deformed
               wing virus, black queen cell virus, and sacbrood virus) among
               pollinator communities with variable species richness,
               abundance, and composition. All three viruses showed a similar
               pattern of prevalence among hosts. Apis mellifera and Bombus
               impatiens had significantly higher viral prevalence than
               Lasioglossum spp. and Eucera pruinosa. In each species, lower
               virus prevalence was most strongly linked with greater

               abundance, species-specific pollinator abundance, and community
               composition were not associated with virus prevalence. Our
               results support a consistent dilution effect for multiple
               viruses and host species. Pollinators in species-rich
               communities had lower viral prevalence than pollinators from
               species-poor communities, when accounting for differences in
               pollinator abundance. Species-rich communities likely had lower
               viral prevalence because species-rich communities contained more
               native bee species likely to be poor viral hosts than
               species-poor communities, and all communities contained the

               prevalence exhibited weaker dilution effects compared to hosts
               with high viral prevalence. Therefore, host species
               susceptibility and competence for each virus may contribute to
               variation in the strength of dilution effects. This study

               Examination of the disaggregated data reveals few

               departures from expected frequencies of female admissions, and
               about as many units appear to favor women as to favor men. If

  abstract  = "Abstract Anthropogenic activities have altered historical
               disturbance regimes, and understanding the mechanisms by which
               these shifting perturbations interact is essential to predicting
               where they may erode ecosystem resilience. Emerging infectious
               plant diseases, caused by human translocation of nonnative
               pathogens, can generate ecologically damaging forms of novel
               biotic disturbance. Further, abiotic disturbances, such as
               wildfire, may influence the severity and extent of
               disease-related perturbations via their effects on the
               occurrence of hosts, pathogens and microclimates; however, these
               interactions have rarely been examined. The disease ?sudden oak
               death? (SOD), associated with the introduced pathogen
               Phytophthora ramorum, causes acute, landscape-scale tree
               mortality in California's fire-prone coastal forests. Here, we
               examined interactions between wildfire and the biotic
               disturbance impacts of this emerging infectious disease.
               Leveraging long-term datasets that describe wildfire occurrence
               and P. ramorum dynamics across the Big Sur region, we modelled
               the influence of recent and historical fires on epidemiological
               parameters, including pathogen presence, infestation intensity,
               reinvasion, and host mortality. Past wildfire altered disease
               dynamics and reduced SOD-related mortality, indicating a
               negative interaction between these abiotic and biotic
               disturbances. Frequently burned forests were less likely to be
               invaded by P. ramorum, had lower incidence of host infection,
               and exhibited decreased disease-related biotic disturbance,
               which was associated with reduced occurrence and density of
               epidemiologically significant hosts. Following a recent
               wildfire, survival of mature bay laurel, a key sporulating host,
               was the primary driver of P. ramorum infestation and reinvasion,
               but younger, rapidly regenerating host vegetation capable of
               sporulation did not measurably influence disease dynamics.
               Notably, the effect of P. ramorum infection on host mortality
               was reduced in recently burned areas, indicating that the loss
               of tall, mature host canopies may temporarily dampen pathogen
               transmission and ?release? susceptible species from significant
               inoculum pressure. Synthesis. Cumulatively, our findings
               indicate that fire history has contributed to heterogeneous
               patterns of biotic disturbance and disease-related decline
               across this landscape, via changes to the both the occurrence of
               available hosts and the demography of epidemiologically
               important host populations. These results highlight that
               human-altered abiotic disturbances may play a foundational role
               in structuring infectious disease dynamics, contributing to
               future outbreak emergence and driving biotic disturbance

              sylvan settings. O. longicaudatus was the most abundant species

              recent scientific debate. In the case of rodent-borne zoonoses,
              there is strong conceptual support, but limited empirical
              evidence, for the hypothesis that defaunation, the loss of large

              indirectly releasing controls on rodent density. We tested this
              hypothesis by experimentally excluding large wildlife from a

              prevalence and abundance of Bartonella spp. infection in rodents
              and their flea vectors. We found no effect of wildlife removal on
              per capita prevalence of Bartonella infection in either rodents

  abstract = "Use of Z values to evaluate nestedness significance is a common
              procedure. An appealing alternative to the use of Z values is
              that of using a value of relative nestedness (RN). However, there
              is no agreement on the preferable procedures to generate the null
              matrices needed to compute both Z and RN. In general, it is
              recommended to use restrictive null models that take into account
              row and column totals. The two most widely used null models of
              this kind, namely, FF and CE [that generate matrices with row and
              column sums equal (FF) or proportional (CE) to the row and column
              totals of the original matrix, respectively], are very different
              in terms of restrictiveness. We performed a set of comparative
              analyses on both theoretical and real matrices to investigate the
              differences between the use of Z and RN values, and between the
              use of FF and CE null models, when NODF (Nestedness metric based
              on overlap and decreasing fill) or $\rho$(A) (i.e., the largest
              eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix) are used to measure
              nestedness. We found no difference in the use of Z or RN values.
              On the other hand, we found that different combinations of
              nestedness measures and null models may lead to inconsistent
              outcomes. Our results offer some clarity on a few issues that,
              despite playing a central role in the practical application of
              nestedness analysis, have been little explored, and highlight the

              are increasing worldwide, driving the need to understand the
              mechanisms that shape outbreaks. Simultaneously, human activities
              are drastically reducing biodiversity. These concurrent patterns
              have prompted repeated suggestions that biodiversity and disease
              are linked. For example, the dilution effect hypothesis posits
              that these patterns are causally related; diverse host
              communities inhibit the spread of parasites via several
              mechanisms, such as by regulating populations of susceptible
              hosts or interfering with parasite transmission. However, the
              generality of the dilution effect hypothesis remains
              controversial, especially for zoonotic diseases of humans. Here
              we provide broad evidence that host diversity inhibits parasite
              abundance using a meta-analysis of 202 effect sizes on 61
              parasite species. The magnitude of these effects was independent
              of host density, study design, and type and specialization of
              parasites, indicating that dilution was robust across all
              ecological contexts examined. However, the magnitude of dilution
              was more closely related to the frequency, rather than density,
              of focal host species. Importantly, observational studies
              overwhelmingly documented dilution effects, and there was also
              significant evidence for dilution effects of zoonotic parasites
              of humans. Thus, dilution effects occur commonly in nature, and
              they may modulate human disease risk. A second analysis
              identified similar effects of diversity in plant--herbivore
              systems. Thus, although there can be exceptions, our results
              indicate that biodiversity generally decreases parasitism and
              herbivory. Consequently, anthropogenic declines in biodiversity
              could increase human and wildlife diseases and decrease crop and
              forest production.",

              identify future priorities. Growing evidence from experimental,
              observational and modelling studies indicates that biodiversity

              diverse mechanisms. Drawing upon lessons from the community

              advances from biodiversity research generally can provide
              necessary theoretical foundations, inform experimental designs,
              and guide future research at the interface between infectious

  author   = "Keesing, F and Holt, R D and Ostfeld, R S",
  abstract = "The transmission of infectious diseases is an inherently
              ecological process involving interactions among at least two, and
              often many, species. Not surprisingly, then, the species
              diversity of ecological communities can potentially affect the
              prevalence of infectious diseases. Although a number of studies
              have now identiﬁed effects of diversity on disease prevalence,
              the mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear in many
              cases. Starting with simple epidemiological models, we describe a
              suite of mechanisms through which diversity could increase or
              decrease disease risk, and illustrate the potential applicability
              of these mechanisms for both vector-borne and non-vector-borne
              diseases, and for both specialist and generalist pathogens. We
              review examples of how these mechanisms may operate in speciﬁc
              disease systems. Because the effects of diversity on multi-host
              disease systems have been the subject of much recent research and
              controversy, we describe several recent efforts to delineate
              under what general conditions host diversity should increase or
              decrease disease prevalence, and illustrate these with examples.
              Both models and literature reviews suggest that high host
              diversity is more likely to decrease than increase disease risk.
              Reduced disease risk with increasing host diversity is especially
              likely when pathogen transmission is frequency-dependent, and
              when pathogen transmission is greater within species than between
              species, particularly when the most competent hosts are also
              relatively abundant and widespread. We conclude by identifying
              focal areas for future research, including (1) describing
              patterns of change in disease risk with changing diversity; (2)
              identifying the mechanisms responsible for observed changes in
              risk; (3) clarifying additional mechanisms in a wider range of
              epidemiological models; and (4) experimentally manipulating

              the disassembly of communities to predictable subsets of species,
              which can be caused by changing climate, land use or invasive
              species, underlies one important hypothesis. In this case,
              infection prevalence could reflect the competence of the
              remaining hosts. To test this hypothesis, we measured local host
              species abundance and prevalence of four generalist
              aphid-vectored pathogens (barley and cereal yellow dwarf viruses)
              in a ubiquitous annual grass host at 10 sites spanning 2000 km

              order in which species are lost on biodiversity--disease

              warming experiment in natural assemblages of alpine meadow
              vegetation on the Qinghai-­Tibetan Plateau, we inferred the
              sequence of plant species losses under fertilization/warming.
              Then the sequence of species losses under fertilization/warming
              was used to simulate the species loss orders (both realistic and
              random) in an adjacently novel removal experiment manipulating

              decrease or increase in infection prevalence, termed the dilution
              and amplification effects, respectively, has been hotly debated
              in disease ecology. Sin Nombre hantavirus, which has an ∼35\%
              mortality rate when it spills over into humans, occurs at a lower
              prevalence in the reservoir host, the North American deermouse,
              in areas with higher small mammal diversity---a dilution effect.
              However, the mechanism driving this relationship is not
              understood. Using a mechanistic mathematical model of infection
              dynamics and a unique long-term, high-resolution, multisite
              dataset, it appears that the observed dilution effect is a result
              of increasing small-mammal diversity leading to decreased
              deermouse population density and, subsequently, prevalence (a
              result of density-dependent transmission). However, once density
              is taken into account, there is an increase in the transmission
              rate at sites with higher diversity---a component amplification
              effect. Therefore, dilution and amplification are occurring at
              the same time in the same host--pathogen system; there is a
              component amplification effect (increase in transmission rate),
              but overall a net dilution because the effect of diversity on
              reservoir host population density is stronger. These results

              mechanisms that drive prevalence and their relative strengths if

              vegetation. The generalized linear modeling indicated that the
              probability of invasion is limited by both dispersal and niche
              constraints. Probability of invasion was positively related to
              precipitation and temperature in the wet season and the presence

              Here we use a multi-species model to study how the scaling of

              diversity-disease relationships. For pathogens with

  abstract = "In an experiment that directly manipulated grassland plant
              species richness and composition, decreased plant species
              richness (``diversity'') increased pathogen load (the percentage
              of leaf area infected by species-speciﬁc foliar pathogens across
              the plant community) in 1998. Pathogen load was almost three
              times greater in the average monoculture than in the average plot
              planted with 24 grassland plant species, an approximately natural
              diversity. Eleven individual diseases increased in severity
              (percentage of leaf area infected by a single disease) at lower
              plant species richness, and severity of only one disease was
              positively correlated with diversity. For 10 of the 11 diseases
              whose severity was negatively related to diversity, disease
              severity was positively correlated with host abundance, and in
              six of these cases, species diversity had no effect on disease
              severity after controlling for the effects of host abundance.
              These results suggest that increased abundances of individual
              host species at lower species diversity increased disease
              transmission and severity. In 1996 and 1997, similar results for
              a smaller number of diseases sampled were found in this
              experiment and another similar one. Although the effect of
              diversity on disease was highly signiﬁcant, considerable variance
              in pathogen load remained among plots of a given diversity level.
              Much of this residual variance was explained by community
              characteristics that were a function of the species composition
              of the communities (the identity of species present vs. those
              lost). Speciﬁcally, communities that lost less diseaseprone
              species had higher pathogen loads; this effect explained more
              variance in pathogen load than did diversity. Also, communities
              that lost the species dominant at high diversity had higher
              pathogen loads, presumably because relaxed competition allowed
              greater increases in host abundances, but this effect was weak.
              Among plant species, disease proneness appeared to be determined
              more by regional than local processes, because it was better
              correlated with frequency of the plant species' populations
              across the region than with local abundance or frequency across
              the state. In total, our results support the hypothesis that
              decreased species diversity will increase foliar pathogen load if
              this increases host abundance and, therefore, disease
              transmission. Additionally, changes in community characteristics

              Explaining prevalence patterns requires an understanding of how
              local determinants of infection, such as community composition,
              are mediated by landscape characteristics and regional-scale
              environmental drivers. Here we investigate the role of local
              community interactions and the effects of landscape structure on
              the dynamics of barley and cereal yellow dwarf viruses (B/CYDV)
              in the open meadows of the Cascade Mountains of Oregon. B/CYDV is
              an aphid-transmitted, generalist pathogen of over 100 wild and
              cultivated grass species. We used variance components analysis
              and model selection techniques to partition the sources of
              variation in B/ CYDV prevalence and to determine which abiotic
              and biotic factors inﬂuence host--pathogen interactions in a

              variation in prevalence among different meadow complexes at a
              larger spatial scale. Variation in prevalence among meadows was
              primarily associated with the local community context (host
              identity, the relative abundance of different host species, and
              host species richness) and the physical landscape attributes of
              the meadow. These results highlight the importance of local host
              community composition, mediated by landscape characteristics such

              diversity can either increase or decrease pathogen transmission
              and disease risk. Theoretical models and laboratory experiments
              have demonstrated that a dilution effect (decreased disease risk
              with increasing diversity) can occur under a wide range of
              conditions. Field studies of plants, aquatic invertebrates,
              amphibians, birds, and mammals demonstrate that the phenomenon
              indeed does occur in many natural systems. A dilution effect is
              expected when (a) hosts differ in quality for pathogens or
              vectors; (b) higher quality hosts tend to occur in species-poor
              communities, whereas lower quality hosts tend to occur in more
              diverse communities; and (c) lower quality hosts regulate
              abundance of high-quality hosts or of vectors, or reduce
              encounter rates between these hosts and pathogens or vectors.
              Although these conditions characterize many disease systems, our
              ability to predict when and where the dilution effect occurs
              remains poor. The life-history traits that cause some hosts to be
              widespread and resilient might be correlated with those that
              promote infection and transmission by some pathogens, supporting
              the notion that the dilution effect might be widespread among
              disease systems. Criticisms of the dilution effect have focused
              on whether species richness or species composition (both being
              metrics of biodiversity) drives disease risk. It is well
              established, however, that changes in species composition
              correlate with changes in species richness, and this correlation
              could explain why the dilution effect appears to be a general

              into the mantra ``biodiversity protects against disease''. The
              basic idea is that by diluting the assemblage of
              transmission-competent hosts with non-competent hosts, the
              probability of vectors feeding on transmission-competent hosts is
              reduced and so the abundance of infected vectors is lowered. The
              same principle has recently been applied to other infectious
              disease systems -- tick-borne, insect-borne, indirectly
              transmitted via intermediate hosts, directly transmitted. It is
              claimed that the presence of extra species of various sorts,
              acting through a variety of distinct mechanisms, causes the
              prevalence of infectious agents to decrease. Examination of the
              theoretical and empirical evidence for this hypothesis reveals
              that it applies only in certain circumstances even amongst
              tick-borne diseases, and even less often if considering the
              correct metric -- abundance rather than prevalence of infected
              vectors. Whether dilution or ampliﬁcation occurs depends more on
              speciﬁc community composition than on biodiversity per se. We

  abstract = "Human-altered ecological disturbances may challenge system
              resilience and disrupt biological legacies maintaining ecosystem
              recovery. Yet, the extent to which novel regimes challenge these
              legacies varies. This may be partially explained by differences
              in the vulnerability of life history strategies to disturbance
              characteristics. In the fire-prone, resprouter-dominated coast
              redwood forests of California, the introduced disease sudden oak
              death (SOD) alters fuel profiles, fire behavior, and aboveground
              tree mortality; however, this system is dominated by resprouting
              trees that are welladapted to aboveground damage, and belowground
              survival of individuals may represent the principal biological
              legacy connecting pre- and post-fire communities. Much of the
              research exploring altered disturbances and forest recovery has
              focused on legacies determined by seed dispersal and aboveground
              survival of adults. In this work, we use pre- and post-fire data
              from a long-term monitoring network to assess the impacts of
              novel disturbance interactions between wildfire and SOD on the
              belowground survival and vegetative reproduction of resprouters.
              We found that increasing accumulation of coarse woody surface
              fuels from SOD-killed hosts decreased the likelihood of
              belowground survival for resprouting tanoak trees, but not for
              redwoods. Tanoaks' belowground survival was negatively related to
              substrate burn severity, which increased with the volume of
              surface fuels from hosts, suggesting heat damage as a possible
              mechanism influencing altered patterns of resprouter mortality.
              These impacts increased with decreasing tree size. By contrast,
              redwood and tanoak trees that survived both disturbances
              resprouted more vigorously, regardless of post-fire infection by
              P. ramorum, and generated similar recruitment at the stand level.
              Our results demonstrate that disease--fire interactions can
              narrow recruitment filters for resprouters, which could impact
              long-term population and demographic structure; yet, compounded
              disturbance may also reduce stand density and disease pressure,
              allowing competitive release of survivors. Resprouters displayed
              vulnerabilities to altered disturbance, but our research suggests
              that legacies maintained by resprouting may be more resilient to
              certain compounded disturbances, compared to seed-obligate
              species, because of high rates of individual survival under
              increasingly severe events. These trends have important
              implications for conservation of declining tree species in
              SOD-impacted forests, as well as predictions of human impacts in
              other disturbance-prone systems where resprouters are present.",

              disease. This focus neglects important extrinsic determinants of
              the host/pathogen dynamic, where all barriers to infection should
              be considered when ascertaining the determinants of infectivity
              and pathogenicity of wildlife pathogens [1, 2, 3]. Those
              pathogens with free-living stages, such as fungi causing
              catastrophic wildlife declines on a global scale [4], must
              confront lengthy exposure to environmental barriers before
              contact with an uninfected host [5, 6, 7, 8]. Hostile
              environmental conditions therefore have the ability to decrease
              the density of infectious particles, reducing the force of
              infection and ameliorating the impact as well as the probability
              of establishing an infection [9]. Here we show that, in nature,
              the risk of infection and infectious burden of amphibians
              infected by the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis
              (Bd) have a significant, site-specific component, and that these
              correlate with the microfauna present at a site. Experimental
              infections show that aquatic microfauna can rapidly lower the
              abundance and density of infectious stages by consuming Bd
              zoospores, resulting in a significantly reduced probability of
              infection in anuran tadpoles. Our findings offer new perspectives
              for explaining the divergent impacts of Bd infection in amphibian
              assemblages and contribute to our understanding of ecosystem
              resilience to colonization by novel pathogens.",

  author   = "Allan, Brian F and Keesing, Felicia and Ostfeld, Richard S",
  abstract = "Abstract: Forest destruction and fragmentation in the United
              States recently have been shown to reduce mammalian species
              diversity and to elevate population densities of white-footed
              mice ( Peromyscus leucopus ). One potential consequence of
              reduced species diversity and high mouse density in small
              fragments is an increase in human exposure to Lyme disease.
              Increased risk of exposure to this disease is expected because of
              the role of the white-footed mouse as the principal natural
              reservoir of the Lyme bacterium, Borrelia burgdorferi.
              Blacklegged ticks ( Ixodes scapularis ) feeding on mice have a
              higher probability of becoming infected with the bacterium than
              do ticks feeding on any other host species. We hypothesized that
              small forest patches ( <2 ha ) have a higher density of infected
              nymphal blacklegged ticks, which is the primary risk factor for
              Lyme disease, than larger patches ( 2--8 ha ). In the summer of
              2000, we sampled tick density and B. burgdorferi infection
              prevalence in 14 maple-dominated forest patches, ranging in size
              from 0.7 to 7.6 ha, in Dutchess County of southeastern New York
              state. We found a significant linear decline in nymphal infection
              prevalence with increasing patch area and a significant
              exponential decline in nymphal density with increasing patch
              area. The consequence was a dramatic increase in the density of
              infected nymphs, and therefore in Lyme disease risk, with
              decreasing forest patch size. We did not observe a similar
              relationship between the density of larval ticks and patch size.
              These results suggest that by influencing the community
              composition of vertebrate hosts for disease-bearing vectors,
              habitat fragmentation can influence human health.",

  abstract = "With growing interest in the effects of biodiversity on disease,
              there is a critical need for studies that empirically identify
              the mechanisms underlying the diversity--disease relationship.
              Here, we combined wetland surveys of host community structure
              with mechanistic experiments involving a multi-host parasite to
              evaluate competing explanations for the dilution effect. Sampling
              of 320 wetlands in California indicated that snail host
              communities were strongly nested, with competent hosts for the
              trematode Ribeiroia ondatrae predominating in low-richness
              assemblages and unsuitable hosts increasingly present in more
              diverse communities. Moreover, competent host density was
              negatively associated with increases in snail species richness.
              These patterns in host community assembly support a key
              prerequisite underlying the dilution effect. Results of
              multigenerational mesocosm experiments designed to mimic
              field-observed community assemblages allowed us to evaluate the
              relative importance of host density and diversity in influencing
              parasite infection success. Increases in snail species richness
              (from one to four species) had sharply negative effects on the
              density of infected hosts (∼90\% reduction). However, this effect
              was indirect; competition associated with non-host species led to
              a 95\% reduction in host density (susceptible host regulation),
              owing primarily to a reduction in host reproduction. Among
              susceptible hosts, there were no differences in infection
              prevalence as a function of community structure, indicating a
              lack of support for a direct effect of diversity on infection
              (encounter reduction). In monospecific conditions, higher initial
              host densities increased infection among adult hosts; however,
              compensatory reproduction in the low-density treatments equalized
              the final number of infected hosts by the next generation,
              underscoring the relevance of multigenerational studies in
              understanding the dilution effect. These findings highlight the
              role of interspecific competition in mediating the relationship
              between species richness and parasite infection and emphasize the
              importance of field-informed experimental research in
